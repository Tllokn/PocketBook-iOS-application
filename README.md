# Description

Many of my friends have a good habit to manage their money. They will buy a notebook or create a note in phone to record every bill. I am going to create an app which can help us record our incomes and consumptions.

It should be very easy use, that is to say, the balance should be very large and can easily get attention, also the user can easily add/delete/edit their record. They can see how they spend their money and when, for what, card or cash etc.
